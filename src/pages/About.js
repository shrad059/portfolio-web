      Hello! I am Shraddha (shra-duh)!!
      <br />
      <br />
      Originally from Illinois, I am currently in my senior year pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science & Physics at <a href="https://www.dal.ca/research.html">Dalhousie University</a>, Canada! 
      <br />
      <br />
      I am passionate about both physics and software engineering, and have been trying to develop my knowledge and skills in both fields. I am particularly interested in machine learning, data analysis, computer simulations, and software development. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Currently, I am working as a research assistant studying properties of battery and its material properties under  <a href="https://penghao-xiao.github.io/xiao_group/">Prof.Penghao Xiao.</a> Over the past two summers, I&apos;ve completed internships at two startups, where I had the opportunity to work as a full-stack software developer intern.
