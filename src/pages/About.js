      Hello! I am Shraddha (shra-duh)!!
      <br />
      <br />
      Hailing from the cornfields of Illinois, I am currently in my senior year pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science & Physics at <a href="">Dalhousie University</a>! 
      <br />
      <br />
      I am passionate about both physics and software engineering, and have been trying to develop my knowledge and skills in both fields. I am particularly interested in machine learning, data analysis, computer simulations, and software development. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Currently, I am working as a research assistant studying properties of battery and its material properties under Prof.Penghao Xiao.
